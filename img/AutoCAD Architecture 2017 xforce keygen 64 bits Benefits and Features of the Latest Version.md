- Edit Live Section - Xref Support: This feature allows you to create a live section view that matches the 2D section and edit the objects within the section result. You can edit objects that reside in nested external references or blocks as well[^1^].
- Modify Section Defining Line: This feature allows you to modify the section line using grips without having to recreate it. You can add or remove vertices, jogs, and curves to the section line[^1^].
- Addition of Shape Option when Adding Objects: This feature allows you to draw shapes like rectangle, circle, polygon, and polyline for objects like wall, curtain wall, railing, slab, and roof. You can draw regular polygon shape boundaries faster and with more accuracy. You can also create tangential curves for objects that do not support an arc option[^1^].
- Smooth Migration: This feature makes it easier to migrate your customization settings from previous versions of AutoCAD. You can organize your settings into groups and categories and generate a migration summary report[^2^].
- Performance Enhancements: This feature improves the performance and reliability of 3DORBIT for rendered visual styles, especially for models with a large number of small blocks containing edges and facets[^3^].

With these new features, AutoCAD Architecture 2017 can help you design and document your architectural projects more efficiently and effectively.
